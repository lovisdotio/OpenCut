# OpenCut

OpenCut is a free, open-source video editor built with Next.js, focusing on privacy (no server processing), multi-track timeline editing, and real-time preview. The project is a monorepo using Turborepo with multiple apps including a web application, desktop app (Tauri), background remover tools, and transcription services.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Privacy First:** All video processing is done in the browser. No files are ever uploaded to a server.
- **Multi-Track Timeline:** A powerful, canvas-based timeline for complex editing.
- **Real-Time Preview:** See your changes instantly.
- **AI-Powered Content Fill:** Seamlessly remove and replace objects in your videos with the power of fal.ai's WAN-VACE 14B model.
- **Performance Optimized:** A highly optimized rendering pipeline ensures smooth editing, even with larger files.

## üß† Architecture Overview

The project is a monorepo managed by Turborepo, with the main web application located in `apps/web`.

- **`apps/web`:** The main Next.js application.
  - **`src/components/editor`:** Core components for the video editor.
  - **`src/stores`:** Zustand stores for state management (`timeline-store`, `media-store`, etc.).
  - **`src/lib`:** Core logic, including the `content-fill-service.ts` which orchestrates the AI video processing.
- **`packages/`:** Shared packages for authentication and database schemas.

## ‚ö° Performance

The application has been heavily optimized for performance:

- **Optimized Video Caching:** Reduces lag and improves playback smoothness.
- **Efficient Frame Caching:** Smart caching of rendered frames to speed up seeking.
- **Intelligent Video Preloading:** Proactively loads video frames around the playhead.
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring:** A built-in debug panel helps track and optimize performance.
